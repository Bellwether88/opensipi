# OpenSIPI
OpenSIPI is an open-source application used to automate signal integrity (SI) and power integrity (PI) related simulations.

## Description
OpenSIPI serves as a platform to read and parse input info that is needed to set up simulations, to generate scripts that can be run by the EDA tools, to launch and monitor simulations running through the EDA tools, to post-process the extracted results and create reports. Currently, OpenSIPI is developed with a focus on S-parameter and DCR extraction.
While OpenSIPI is open-sourced free of charge, the supported back-end simulation solvers are still commercialized tools. The successful extraction of the desired results are subject to the availability of proper commerical licenses.

## Installation
Open a terminal or command window. Install the tool using the following command.
```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/rivosinc/opensipi
```

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
